## Code of Conduct

You can find the UAL Disciplinary Code For Students here: [Disciplinary Code For Students](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/student-regulations/disciplinary-code-for-students).

You can find our code of conduct here: [code_of_conduct.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), it was cloned from <https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>.

[Golan Levin](https://www.flong.com/) also offers a useful thought from his children's school:

> When communicating, ask yourself:
>
> - T ‚Äì is it True?
> - H ‚Äì is it Helpful?
> - I ‚Äì is it Inspiring?
> - N ‚Äì is it Necessary?
> - K ‚Äì is it Kind?

## Course/Block/Term Structure

As mentioned above, The [Diploma in Apple Development](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/ual-diploma-in-apple-development) is split into two Blocks of teaching. **Block 1** takes up the entire Autumn term and half of the Spring term. **Block 2** follows on, taking the second half of Spring term and the entire Summer term.

![Course Structure Image](/CourseDiagram.png)

### Block 1 Structure

Block 1 consists of three units, with Coding One and Product One taught in parallel, with ML One weighted to the second half of Block 1.

- **Coding One**: Swift and Swift UI. Drawing on Apple‚Äôs "Develop in Swift Fundamentals" curriculum.  This unit gives you the opportunity to develop your coding skills in the Swift language and introduces the Swift UI frameworks key to the practice of Apple application development and prototyping. Taught by [Joel Gethin Lewis](https://joelgethinlewis.com).
- **Product One**: Team App Design, User Experience Research and Rapid prototyping. Drawing on Apple‚Äôs "Develop in Swift Explorations" curriculum.  This unit explores the process of designing apps for the iOS platform and introduces UX methodologies, collaborative development approaches and high-fidelity prototyping using Apple tools. Taught by [Joel Gethin Lewis](https://joelgethinlewis.com).
- **ML One**: Introducing Machine Learning with Core ML. The unit is a mix of practical tasks introducing the core Apple ML frameworks and seminars that look at emerging practice across the arts and creative industries that employ some level of artificial intelligence. Taught by [Xiaowan Yi](https://xiaowan-yi.com).

### Block 2 Structure

Block 2 consists of three units, studied in parallel:

- **Coding Two**: Further Apple Frameworks. This unit explores further Apple frameworks to develop 2D games. You will gain experience using frameworks such as SpriteKit. Taught by [Joel Gethin Lewis](https://joelgethinlewis.com).
- **Product Two**: Individual App Design and Launch. In this unit you will develop an app concept for Apple‚Äôs iOS. This will give you both an understanding of the development process using the standard Apple development tools and build on your Swift learning in an applied context. Taught by [Joel Gethin Lewis](https://joelgethinlewis.com).
- **ML Two**: Making Models with Create ML. This unit explores the creation of bespoke Machine Learning models using Apple tools and specifically the Create ML framework. Taught by [Xiaowan Yi](https://xiaowan-yi.com).

## Assessment

## UAL-wide assessment criteria

Please read [UAL's guidance for students on how they will be assessed](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment). [TLDR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TLDR): you will be assessed on the following 5 assessment criteria (quoting from [UAL's page](https://www.arts.ac.uk/study-at-ual/academic-regulations/course-regulations/assessment)):

1. **Enquiry**
   - Enquiry is about active learning and reflection. It‚Äôs how you explore, research and learn about your subject. Enquiry is central to all creative learning at UAL.
2. **Knowledge**
   - Knowledge is about gathering information and enhancing understanding. It‚Äôs how you inform your work, explore diverse cultures and connections and appreciate what you do in a wider context.
3. **Process**
   - Process is about your journey of learning. It‚Äôs how you take risks and experiment. And how you keep the creative momentum going ‚Äî developing ideas from start to finish.
4. **Communication**
   - Communication is about telling the story of your learning and making. It‚Äôs how you share your learning with an audience, presenting and explaining your work to different people.
5. **Realisation**
   - Realisation is about the work you create and how this reveals what you‚Äôve learned. It‚Äôs taking a look back and evaluating the work you‚Äôve produced.
