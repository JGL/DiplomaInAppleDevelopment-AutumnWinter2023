  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Yay! Let's begin by reviewing your Manifestation apps aka "If you had all the time and money you needed, what would you do with your life?" apps. Who wants to go first?</div>
  <div>Great! Let's continue by reviewing the Collections and Loops playgrounds.</div>
  <div>Brill! Let's finish up the homework reviews by looking at the "Lab Basic Interactions" app from the end of last week's lecture.</div>
  <div>Slay! Let's move onto Lesson 2.11: Auto Layout and Stack Views. Let's review what you are going to learn before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 311 of the student guide, before working through the "AutoLayoutPractice" as group, starting on back 312 of the student guide. Next, let's work through the "Lab - Calculator", with me leading and everyone following along individually. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 355 together.</div>
  <div>Woop! Let's continue by working through the Guided Project: Apple Pie together.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
