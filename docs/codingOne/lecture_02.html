  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's start by reading the introduction part of "Develop in Swift Fundamentals" - btw, we'll be going through the "App Design Workbook" in our Friday "Product One" lectures! </div>
  <div>Let's move onto Lesson 1.2: "Introduction to Swift and Playgrounds". Let's discuss what you'll understand by the end of this session before moving onto the Keynote, and then finally the exercise.</div>
  <div>Next is Lesson 1.3: "Constants, Variables, and Data Types". Let's discuss what you'll understand by the end of this session before moving onto the Keynote, and then finally the exercise.</div>
  <div>Onto Lesson 1.4: "Operators"! Let's discuss what you'll understand by the end of this session before moving onto the Keynote, and then finally the exercise.</div>
  <div>Hark! It's time for Lesson 1.5: "Control Flow"! Let's discuss what you'll understand by the end of this session before moving onto the Keynote, and then finally the exercise.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
