  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>How did all the Playgrounds go from the last lecture? All ok? Would you like me to review any of them?</div>
  <div>Slay! Let's move onto Lesson 3.6: Enumerations. Let's review what you are going to learn on page 427 of the student guide, before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 428 of the student guide. Next, let's work through the "Lab-Enumerations.playground", with me leading and everyone following along individually. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 434 of the student guide together.</div>
  <div>Joy joy! Let's move onto Lesson 3.7: Segues and Navigation Controllers. Let's review what you are going to learn on page 435 of the student guide, before going onto the Keynote. Next, let's work through the TrafficSegues project together, starting on page 436 of the student guide. I'd like you to complete the "Lab-Login" project starting on page 468 of the student guide as homework. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 473 of the student guide together.</div>
