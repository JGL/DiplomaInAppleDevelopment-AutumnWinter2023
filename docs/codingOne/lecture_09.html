  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Ace! Let's begin by reviewing your Calculator apps and your Apple Pie apps - did they go ok?</div>
  <div>Slay! Let's move onto Unit 3: Navigation and Workflows. Let's review the Swift and SDK lessons we'll be looking at next - on page 388 of the Swift Fundamentals Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Yay! Let's quickly review Lesson 3.1: Prepare to Test Your App, on page 390 of the Student Guide. As always, this would be saved for Product One - but as I'll be striking I think it's worth taking a look at related resources from WWDC 2018 and WWDC 2019 - lots of great tips on presenting Design Work.</div>

Let's review what you are going to learn on page 392, before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 393 of the student guide. Next, let's work through the "Lab-Optionals.playground", with me leading and everyone following along individually. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 405 together.</div>
  <div>Top! Let's move onto Lesson 3.3: Type Casting and Inspection. Let's review what you are going to learn on page 406, before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 407 of the student guide.

  <div>Huzzah! Let's move onto Lesson 3.4: Guard. Let's review what you are going to learn on page 412, before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 413 of the student guide. Next, let's work through the "Lab-Guard.playground", with me leading and everyone following along individually. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 419 together.</div>
  <div>Joy joy! Let's move onto Lesson 3.5: Constant and Variable Scope.
