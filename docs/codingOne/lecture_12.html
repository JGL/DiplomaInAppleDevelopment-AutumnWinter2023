  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>Happy New Year! 🎉</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>How did you get on with the homework?
    <ul>
      <li>Complete the Login Lab that you didn't do!</li>
      <li>Complete the Rainbow challenge on page 496 of the student guide - "Change the tab bar controller to use three navigation controllers as its viewControllers. Each navigation >controller’s root view controller should be one of the coloured view controllers."</li>
      <li>Complete the the Tab Bar Controllers "About Me" Lab!</li>
      <li>Complete the "Lab - order of events" from the View Controller Life Cycle chapter</li>
      <li>Complete the "Lab - Pizza Delivery" - solution as always in the teacher.zip file!</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Great! Let's move onto the Guided Project: Personality Quiz. Let's review what you are going to learn on page 533, before working through the guided project together. The aim is complete this project together today, with next week being used for a mock multiple choice and a mock practical coding exam. 👩🏻‍🏫</div>
