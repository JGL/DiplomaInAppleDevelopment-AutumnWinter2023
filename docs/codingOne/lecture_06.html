  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Last time, we got to page 17 of 34 in the Structures Keynote. Let's go back to that slide - please, open and complete the following exercises in "Lab - Structures.playground":
    <ul>
      <li>Exercise - Structs, Instances, and Default Values</li>
      <li>App Exercise - Workout Tracking</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Once you've completed those, I'll continue with the rest of the Keynote, and after completing the Structures Playground, let's go through the Review Questions on page 206 of your Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Boom! Let's move onto Lesson 2.5: Classes and Inheritance. Let's review what you are going to learn before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 207 of the Student Guide, before finishing with the Classes and Inheritance Playground Lab. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 221 together.</div>
  <div>Nice! Let's move onto Lesson 2.6: Collections. Let's review what you are going to learn before going onto the Keynote, reviewing the knowledge starting on page 222 of the student guide, before finishing with the Collections Playground Lab. As a bonus, let's complete the Review Questions on page 234 together. </div>
  <div>
