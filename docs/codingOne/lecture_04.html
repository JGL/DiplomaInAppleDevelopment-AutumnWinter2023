  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Yesss! It's time for Lesson 1.9! "Interface Builder Basics"! Let's discuss what you'll understand by the end of this session before moving onto the Keynote, and then finally the exercise.</div>
  <div>Now let's work through the Guided Project: Light together. We are at the end of Unit 1!</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
