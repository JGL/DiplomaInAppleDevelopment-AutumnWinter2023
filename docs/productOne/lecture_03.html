  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Now let's do an exercise from the teachers guide - "Word Games: Review and Discuss" from page 88.</div>
  <div>Now let's read the next part of the student guide together - 1.3 "Build a PhotoFrame App" - you are going to build your first iOS app, starting on page 48 of your student guide.</div>
  <div>Now as homework, I want you to complete the "Build a PhotoFrame App: Apply and Extend" exercise individually for the next lecture - see page 96 of the teachers guide.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
