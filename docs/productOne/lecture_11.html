  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    How did your homework go?
    <ul>
      <li>Do user surveys... learn from them</li>
      <li>Complete Swift Explorations up to but not including ChatBot (i.e. do Colour Mix AND complete Bouncy Ball example apps)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section 4.2 part B "ChatBot", starting on page 346 of the student guide. After completing that, let's review the same section in the Teacher Guide, starting on page 550.</div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section 4.2 part C "Rock, Paper, Scissors", starting on page 368 of the student guide. After completing that, let's review the same section in the Teacher Guide, starting on page 576.</div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
