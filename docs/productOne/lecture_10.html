  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, let's do our group crits. Please make sure you've copied your presentations to my computer.</div>
  <div>Third, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>How did the last lecture's homework go? How were "Password Security", "Visualisation Revisited" and "Build a BouncyBall App"?</div>
  </div>
  <div>Now let's review section 3.4 together - "Design a Prototype", starting on page 260 of the Student Guide.
  </div>
  <div>Let's complete Episode 3 together - "Sharing Photos", starting on page 269 of the student guide.</div>
  <div>Let's start Unit 4 - "Building Apps", reading page 286 of the Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Now let's move onto Unit 4.1 - "Get Started with App Development", starting on page 288 of the Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Now let's move onto Unit 4.2 - "Play with App Components", starting on page 299 of the student guide. Let's start with section 4.2 part A "Color Picker" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic">sic</a>), starting on page 301 of the student guide. After completing that, let's review the same section in the Teacher Guide, starting on page 502.</div>
