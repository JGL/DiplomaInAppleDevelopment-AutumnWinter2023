  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's by reviewing the homework from last week - starting with reviewing your App flow diagrams and revealing the code name for your app.
  </div>
  <div>How did the "Instances, Methods and Properties", "Arrays and Loops" and "Structures" playgrounds go? Should I review them? What about the Better Explained articles and Big O notation Wikipedia article?</div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section D - "Enums and Switch". Let's start with page 206 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 350 of the teacher guide.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section E - "Testing Code". Let's start with page 209 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 357 of the teacher guide.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section F - "Processing Data". Let's start with page 212 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 365 of the teacher guide.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section G - "Pixel Art". Let's start with page 215 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 371 of the teacher guide.
