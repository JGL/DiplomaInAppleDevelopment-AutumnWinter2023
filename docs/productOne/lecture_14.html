  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>
    Which of the two groups wants to present first? 30 minutes per presentation.
  </div>
  <div>
    What went well? What went badly? Next steps? Do you know how to submit your zip files of your presentations?
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks!<br /><a href="../index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
