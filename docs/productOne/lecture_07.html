  <div>Hi!</div>
  <div>First, don't forget to confirm your attendance using the Seats Mobile app!</div>
  <div>Second, I'm going to start every lecture with a meditation from the fantastic <a href="https://www.shambhala.com/sittingstilllikeafrog/">Sitting Still Like a Frog book</a>, all read by Myla Kabat-Zinn. If you don't want to participate that's completely fine.</div>
  <div>Let's review the homework, Section 2.4 "Design an Experience" - let's see the app flowcharts for each group.</div>
  <div>Next, onto "Episode 2 - The Viewing Party" on page 164 of your Student Guide.</div>
  <div>Onto Unit 3 - "Organizing Data" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic">sic</a>) - see page 181 of your student guide. Let's work through section 3.1 - "Get Started with Organizing Data" together - see page 183.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section 3.2 - "Play with Complex Data". Let's start with page 193 of the student guide. And then onto section A - "Instances, Methods and Properties" on page 196. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 325.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section B - "Arrays and Loops". Let's start with page 199 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 331.
  </div>
  <div>Now let's move onto section C - "Structures". Let's start with page 203 of the student guide. Once we've done that, let's look at the accompanying section in the teacher guide, starting on page 342.
